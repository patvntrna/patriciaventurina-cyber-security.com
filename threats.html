								<p style="font-size: 25px;"><em><strong>What is a Cyber Security Threat?</strong></em></p>
								<p>A cyber security threat refers to any possible malicious attack that seeks to unlawfully access data, disrupt digital operations or damage information. Cyber threats can originate from various actors, including corporate spies, hacktivists, terrorist groups, hostile nation-states, criminal organizations, lone hackers and disgruntled employees.</p>
								<p>Cyber attackers can use an individual’s or a company’s sensitive data to steal information or gain access to their financial accounts, among other potentially damaging actions, which is why cyber security professionals are essential for keeping private data protected.</p>
								<p style="font-size: 30px;"><strong>7 TYPES OF CYBER THREAT</strong></p>
								<p><strong style="font-size: 20px;">1. Malware</strong> - is malicious software such as spyware, ransomware, viruses and worms. Malware is activated when a user clicks on a malicious link or attachment, which leads to installing dangerous software. Cisco reports that malware, once activated, can block access to key network components (ransomware), install additional harmful software, covertly obtain information by transmitting data from the hard drive (spyware), and disrupt individual parts, making the system inoperable.</p>
								<p><strong style="font-size: 20px;">2. Emotet</strong> - The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) describes Emotet as “an advanced, modular banking Trojan that primarily functions as a downloader or dropper of other banking Trojans. Emotet continues to be among the most costly and destructive malware.”</p>
								<p><strong style="font-size: 20px;">3. Denial of Service</strong> - A denial of service (DoS) is a type of cyber attack that floods a computer or network so it can’t respond to requests. A distributed DoS (DDoS) does the same thing, but the attack originates from a computer network. Cyber attackers often use a flood attack to disrupt the “handshake” process and carry out a DoS. Several other techniques may be used, and some cyber attackers use the time that a network is disabled to launch other attacks. A botnet is a type of DDoS in which millions of systems can be infected with malware and controlled by a hacker, according to Jeff Melnick of Netwrix, an information technology security software company. Botnets, sometimes called zombie systems, target and overwhelm a target’s processing capabilities. Botnets are in different geographic locations and hard to trace.</p>
								<p><strong style="font-size: 20px;">4. Man in the Middle</strong> - A man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack occurs when hackers insert themselves into a two-party transaction. After interrupting the traffic, they can filter and steal data, according to Cisco. MITM attacks often occur when a visitor uses an unsecured public Wi-Fi network. Attackers insert themselves between the visitor and the network, and then use malware to install software and use data maliciously.</p>
								<p><strong style="font-size: 20px;">5. Phishing</strong> - Phishing attacks use fake communication, such as an email, to trick the receiver into opening it and carrying out the instructions inside, such as providing a credit card number. “The goal is to steal sensitive data like credit card and login information or to install malware on the victim’s machine,” Cisco reports.</p>
								<p><strong style="font-size: 20px;">6. SQL Injection</strong> - A Structured Query Language (SQL) injection is a type of cyber attack that results from inserting malicious code into a server that uses SQL. When infected, the server releases information. Submitting the malicious code can be as simple as entering it into a vulnerable website search box.</p>
								<p><strong style="font-size: 20px;">7. Password Attacks</strong> - With the right password, a cyber attacker has access to a wealth of information. Social engineering is a type of password attack that Data Insider defines as “a strategy cyber attackers use that relies heavily on human interaction and often involves tricking people into breaking standard security practices.” Other types of password attacks include accessing a password database or outright guessing.</p>
